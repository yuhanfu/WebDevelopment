    <h3>Being Mortal</h3>
    
    <img src="./images/beingmortal.jpeg"/>
    
    <p>Riveting, honest, and humane, Being Mortal shows that the ultimate goal is not a good death but a good life – 
      all the way to the very end.</p> 

    <ul>
      <li>In his bestselling books, Atul Gawande, a practicing surgeon, has fearlessly revealed the struggles of his 
        profession. Now he examines its ultimate limitations and failures – in his own practices as well as others’ 
        – as life draws to a close. And he discovers how we can do better.</li>
      <li>He follows a hospice nurse on her rounds, a geriatrician in his clinic, and reformers turning nursing homes 
        upside down. He finds people who show us how to have the hard conversations and how to ensure we never sacrifice 
        what people really care about.</li>
    </ul>
